User interface has been overhauled for ease-of-use.

Templates are now stored as simple objects with a "name" and "body" field instead of complicated line-by-line objects.

Fields for variables only show if they are used by the selected template.

# TODO

Add more templates.

Add autocomplete search for selecting templates and for item names.
