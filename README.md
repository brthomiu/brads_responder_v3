User interface has been overhauled for ease-of-use.

Templates are now stored as simple objects with a "name" and "body" field instead of complicated line-by-line objects.

Fields for variables only show if they are used by the selected template.

# TODO

Add more templates.

Add autocomplete search for selecting templates and for item names.

Add premade notes for security key, sulafat headset, etc...

The user's last viewed template should be saved so that closing/opening the plugin doesn't reset to the default template.
